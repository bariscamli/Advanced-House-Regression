# Advanced-House-Regression

Welcome to my notebook. This is my second notebook ever in the Kaggle platform and I choose housing price competition which is a getting started competition for beginners. 
The competition is about predicting houses sale prices in Ames, Iowa with the given tabular data.

In the notebook, I try to explain functions with commands and headers also in this notebook I get 0.12687 point which means top 25% in the leaderboard.
