# Advanced-House-Regression

Welcome to my notebook. This is my second notebook ever in the Kaggle platform and I choose housing price competition which is a getting started competition for beginners. 
The competition is about predicting houses sale prices in Ames, Iowa with the given tabular data.

In the notebook, I try to explain functions with comments and headers also in this notebook I get 0.12687 point which means top 25% in the leaderboard.

You can read the data_description.txt to clarify features meaning.

I suggest that the notebook should be opened in nbviewer (link on the top right after you open the notebook) because some of the plots cannot be seen due to github viewer.

For my other notebooks, You can visit https://www.kaggle.com/mcamli.

Thanks for any comment and suggestions.
